# Optimization Cases â€“ Business Applications of Operations Research

This project is part of the **Business Administration** course in the **Bachelor of Computer Science** program at **Vietnamese-German University (VGU)**.

We explore how to **optimize real-world business problems** using **Excel**, based on case studies from the book *Business Applications of Operations Research*. The goal is to understand how operations research helps improve decision-making in areas like:

- Production planning  
- Transportation and logistics  
- Resource allocation  
- Scheduling  

## ðŸ’¡ Whatâ€™s Inside

- Excel models solving real business problems  
- Focus on practical applications of optimization techniques  

This project bridges **computer science** and **business strategy** through hands-on learning with data-driven tools.
